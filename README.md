***Here is my Interpretation of growth mindset***

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Growth Mindset, I have found that during my time in the services also life in general can be life changing. The ability to turn constructive criticism and failures to something tangible to utilize also how to convey criticism correctly is a valuable skill. I have learned that some times when going about my day I have allot of moments where I feel unmotivated, defeated all the emoitions. This exposure to include the negative has been a key element I feel. Also some times not allowing alternatives for example I use a small milk crate for my laundrey. I usually have clean clothes even in my funks due to the fact it only allows so much clothes. One of the biggest life changing moments that turned me towards a growth mindset is my views on failure. I have included it in my core concepts I have created to tackle a coding boot camp for the second time. The best advice I can give you is watch some videos on the universe and vibrations. how resonating frequencies have a huge effect, for Example when you with your friends vibing your brainwaves actually sync up.

*:alien: just as an oscillating sinewave fluctuates, synchronize your life to what you want to be when it happens it will be like falling inlove :alien:*
