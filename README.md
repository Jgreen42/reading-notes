***Here is my Interpretation of growth mindset***

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Growth Mindset, I have found that during my time in the services also life in general can be life changing. The ability to turn constructive criticism and failures to something tangible to utilize also how to convey criticism correctly is a valuable skill. I have learned that some times when going about my day I have allot of moments where I feel unmotivated, defeated all the emoitions. This exposure to include the negative has been a key element I feel. Also some times not allowing alternatives for example I use a small milk crate for my laundrey. I usually have clean clothes even in my funks due to the fact it only allows so much clothes. One of the biggest life changing moments that turned me towards a growth mindset is my views on failure. I have included it in my core concepts I have created to tackle a coding boot camp for the second time. The best advice I can give you is watch some videos on the universe and vibrations. how resonating frequencies have a huge effect, for Example when you with your friends vibing your brainwaves actually sync up.

*:alien: just as an oscillating sinewave fluctuates, synchronize your life to what you want to be when it happens it will be like falling inlove :alien:*

<li>- always making sure to keep positive even in the times of hardship, its like hidden virutal tools ready to be found.</li> :hurtrealbad: 
<li>- making sure my work area is clean and my enviroment is productive. Also being sure to utilize all my resources available to me</li> :rage1:
<li>- I feel keeping a moment in the day couple times and reflecting on what needs to be done, what do we need also known issues possibly could be used as a positive. knowledge learned is never a bad thing. You will use it later.</li> :godmode:

>my name is Joshua Green but you can call me Josh, I was born here in the PNW and raised. I spent over 9 years in the Army which has allowed me to really challenge my self. Recently changing my views on failure and my mental process on how I approach challenges whether personal or professional has changed. Learning code regardless the level I am at has changed my life and let me say I feel really good about it! I hope to make it apart of my future and make some contributions but create some futuristic things or work with space data. I am very art driven as well, myself and my family all have their art gene suppose.
>>I have two Dogs A german Shepherd aswell a 155 pound great dane. We go jogging everynight and mostly take lunar photos and listen to techno or heavy metal, lofi ect what ever we are vibing.
